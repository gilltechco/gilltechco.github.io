Our Ontario Driving Knowledge Quiz app does not collect any personal information from users. We do not require you to provide any personal data such as name, email address, or phone number to use the App.

Ad Serving

The App may display third-party advertisements to support its free availability. These ads are provided by advertising networks or providers that may collect certain non-personal information about your device and app usage. This information is used to deliver targeted ads and measure their effectiveness.

The advertising networks or providers may use technologies such as cookies or mobile advertising identifiers to serve relevant ads. These technologies allow them to track your interactions with the ads and tailor the ad content based on your interests.

Please note that we do not have control over the information collected by third-party advertisers. Therefore, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of the ad networks or providers to understand how they handle your information.

The App may include images for the sole purpose of providing visual content related to Ontario driving knowledge. These images are embedded within the App and are not transmitted to or stored on our servers.

Data Security

We take reasonable measures to ensure the security of the App and protect it against unauthorized access, loss, or alteration. However, please note that no data transmission over the internet or storage method is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of the App.
